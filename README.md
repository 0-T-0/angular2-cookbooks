# Angular2 Cookbooks

Working with Angular2 is a little tricky right now : framework not yet stable, finding documentation is a little bit hard.
So to help newbe's like me, I've started this list of quick and simple cookbooks of some common things to build an angular2 application.

Each cookbook has a defined format : Prerequisites, last tested Angular2 version (as it is always changing), a plunker with the result and may be additional ressources.

## Bootstrap

 * [Bootstrap an Angular2 application](bootstrap.md)

## Services

 * [Create an Angular2 service](service.md)

## Components

 * [Create a component with inputs and outputs : A search form](component-input-output.md)

## Pipes

 * [Create an Angular2 Pipe : A truncate pipe](pipe.md)
